## Description

### MVP
- A working application, hosted
- 2 URL Paths - Dashboard and Login/Signup
- Card components (CRUD)

---

## User Stories
- All users can create account
- As normal users, can read and update cards
- As admin user, can create, read, update and delete cards
- When a card component is to be created, there should be an option to highlight if team or individual metric
    - Table layout will remain the same between individual and team 
- All users can add AND delete rows and columns and edit their respective row
- Each metric is a card component - CRUD
    - Users can click a button and a new card is created on the dashboard
    - Each card on dashboard will show latest data only (% variance WoW) <- this is the TEAM total   
    - When the card is clicked, all other cards are hidden and the card is expanded
    - The expanded card shows a table and users can edit their corresponding rows
    - Admin can only delete cards
- As a user, I should be able to login, be presented with dashboard insights immediately
